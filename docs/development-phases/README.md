# Development phases — Cursor prompts and summaries

This folder holds **documentation of the development phases** for the ai_risk_engine project. The contents are:

- **Prompts** — The specification/prompt text given to Cursor (or similar) to implement each phase. These are not used at runtime by the application.
- **Summaries** — What was implemented, what was changed in docs, and any follow-up work (e.g. tests, fixes).

They are kept here for reference and to keep the `app/` tree free of non-code assets.
